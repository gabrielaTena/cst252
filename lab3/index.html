	<h1> Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<h2> Subject</h2>
	<p> The big idea of this lab was to create local file structure on our computer
		and create index.html files.</p>
		<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p> Working on this lab was relaively easy since I remember how to create/duplicate
		files in Atom. Also, organizing files in my computer is something I will take
	 	care of because it will be easier and probably faster to find files that way. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> Here are my results</p>
