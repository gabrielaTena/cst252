			<h2> Subject</h2>
			<p> The purpose of the lab is to experiment with anonymous functions
				and callbacks.</p>

			<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> I had some difficulties understanding the assigment but was able to
				finish it by following Wes's example. I was confused about testing
				the fuction because I wasn't sure what to write inside the parenthesis.
				Overall, I was able to get more familiar with functions and understanding
				it a bit more.</p>
