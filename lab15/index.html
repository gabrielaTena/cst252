		 		<p>In order to solve the output problem I had, I inspected the console
					and compared my code to my partner's and Wes's code. I noticed I had
					written a "document.writeln" for the output so I deletead one
					of them, I also added a sortUserName and the shuffleArray functions which
					all together made my page work as expected.</p>

					<p>The problem I had is this lab was that once I typed the name, I couldn't
						see the output. I looked into my partner's lab and the console to see where
						to start. I was missing the function that makes the first letter Capital.
						I also had a syntax error in the "toTitleCase" function which wasn't
						letting the output show up.</p>

						<p>For this lab, I wasn't able to see the output of the button; only
							on the console. I decided to reference Wes's page and change some things
							since I was having a diffiult time trying to figure out the assigment.</p>
