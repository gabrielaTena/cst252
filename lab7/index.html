			<p> The purpose of the lab is to write functions that take user input
				and manipulate a string.</p>

			<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> This lab was challenging for me because JavaScript is very new to me.
			I followed Wes' lab examples to have as a reference. When I try to see
			my page, the question about the name appears but it doesn't show the result.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="results" class="minor-section">
			<h2> Results</h2>
			<p> You are looking at my index.html file and js script output:</p>

		<div id="debuging" class="debuging">
			<h2> Debuging</h2>
			<p> In order to solve the output problem I had, I inspected the console
				and compared my code to my partner's and Wes's code. I noticed I had
				written a "document.writeln" for the output so I deletead one
				of them, I also added a sortUserName and the shuffleArray functions which
				all together made my page work as expected.
