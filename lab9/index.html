			<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> One challenge that I had was that I was missing my js folder. Whenever
				I tried to inspect the console or look for the folder on the sources
				pannel, I couldn't find the folder. I solved this by duplicating a
				previous lab where the js worked good and I was able to make it work.</p>
